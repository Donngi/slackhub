# STEP2 Implement tool's lambda in your favorite language
In this step, you'll implement your tool's lambda.

SlackHub is designed to work regardless of the language of the latter program. **You can use any language you love!**

## JSON sent from SlackHub to your lambda
![Role of SlackHub](https://github.com/Jimon-s/slackhub/blob/images/role.png)

Once users submit a modal view, SlackHub authorize the message and pass the input params to your lambda.

You can see a sample of the JSON in [Slack's developer website](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission) (See view.submission event).

Remember that user's input data is in
```
view.state
```
field. 

### Convenient parameter
SlackHub adds some convenient params in the JSON.

In `view.private_metadata` field, you can see below.

```json
{
    "response_url": "https://xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "channel_id"  : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

`response_url`

This field includes the url tied to the slack channel. You can send a message to slack only sending POST request to this url.

```
POST https://xxxxxxxxxxx
Content-type: application/json
{
    "text": "YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE!"
}
```

You can send messages **within 30 minutes up to 5 times**. If you send a message by response_url, it replaces the slackhub's wait message. (@USER invokes XXXX. Please wait a moment.)

`channel_id`

This field includes the channel ID of the slack channel. If you learn Slack API and want to send a message by API, you can use this ID.

## Best Practice
To create more user friendly tools, I recommend you to **send a compression message**.

When you send, please use the `response_url` descrebed above.

## Implement your tool
That â€™s all for the explanation. Let's implement your tool's lambda and deploy to your AWS account!

We provide you some example codes in this repository. Please see [the sample directly](https://github.com/Jimon-s/slackhub/blob/master/examples).
